copied from https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.3.1/examples on Sep 14, 2022 (commit 484fd76 on Aug 26, 2022).

All of the examples in this directory are for the same SPDX document.  Most of the supported document elements are present.

NOTE: The XML format is still a work in progress.  The XML example is intended to be a working document for use by the SPDX team in evaluating the XML format as a candidate for release 3.0.
