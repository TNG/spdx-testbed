copied from https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.2.2/examples on Sep 14, 2022 (commit d12bb17 on Sep 29, 2021).

All of the examples in this directory are for the same SPDX document.  Most of the supported document elements are present.

NOTE: The XML format is still a work in progress.  The XML example is intended to be a working document for use by the SPDX team in evaluating the XML format as a candidate for release 3.0.
